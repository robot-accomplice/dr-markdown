## Architext Architecture Documentation

This project uses `docs/architext/data/**/*.json` as the machine-readable
architecture and release source of truth.

Derive what you record in those JSON files from the **source code only**.
Existing architecture documentation — prose READMEs, design docs, diagrams,
comments, and even prior Architext claims — may be stale, aspirational, or
wrong; do not treat any of it as authoritative for what the system actually is.
Read the code to determine real responsibilities, flows, data movement,
dependencies, and trust boundaries. Treat existing documents as unverified
hints at most, verify every claim against the code, and when code and a
document disagree, the code wins. (This governs the architecture you record;
this contract and the schema still govern how you record it.)

`docs/architext/data/manifest.json` records the Architext data schema version.
That version tracks the JSON data contract, not the installed CLI/package
version. Additive schema changes may ship in minor releases; breaking schema
changes require a major semver release and an Architext-managed migration path.

When changing architecture, data flow, persistence, external integrations, trust
boundaries, deployment topology, observability paths, or major module
responsibilities, update the relevant Architext JSON files before completing the
task.

When release scope, blockers, milestones, posture, evidence, or target dates
change, update Release Truth data under `docs/architext/data/releases/`.
Release Truth is the reviewed release source of truth: completed work,
deferrals, reprioritization, blockers, dependencies, and next actions belong in
the release detail file, with `releases/index.json` refreshed from those facts.
Keep Release Path labels concise and put long context in the selected release
item's detail data.

When `architext doctor` recovers a damaged or incomplete data file it backs up
the original under a timestamped `.bak` name and records the recovery in
`docs/architext/data/repair-advice.json`. Reconciling recovered content is the
maintaining agent's responsibility: replace every backfilled placeholder with
real facts from the backup, the source code, and git history; run `architext
validate`; then delete the backup file and remove the resolved advice entry.
Do not treat recovered placeholders as reviewed facts.

When planning a future release, use `docs/architext/data/roadmap.json` as the
roadmap source and Release Planning as the approval boundary. Selected roadmap
items keep `source: "roadmap"`; manually entered scope uses `source:
"ad-hoc"` and should be promoted into `roadmap.json` when the plan is approved.
Do not represent unreviewed planning proposals as current Release Truth facts.

When project rules change, update `docs/architext/data/rules.json`.
Categories are maintainer-defined classifications such as Architecture,
Development, Design, Release, or any project-specific grouping. Respect
`protection.edit` and `protection.delete`; protected rules are not casual
cleanup targets. Rank rules by `criticality` and `order`, not alphabetical
order or creation time.

Element notes are human annotations on an architecture element (node, flow,
decision, risk, view, or data class), persisted in the optional
`docs/architext/data/notes.json` and registered as `manifest.files.notes`.
Each note records `target: { kind, id }`, a `category`
(`note` | `mitigation` | `caveat` | `todo`), a `body`, and timestamps; the
note's `target.id` must reference an existing element (validation enforces
this). Notes capture maintainer judgement — for example, that a high-risk
area is intentionally mitigated by the documented system — so treat them as
user-owned: preserve and update them, but do not fabricate notes or delete a
human's note as cleanup. They are edited in the viewer (the detail panel's
Notes section) and never replace validation or recorded architecture facts.

When ordered work or use-case paths deserve a dedicated Flows projection, add a
`workflow` view in `docs/architext/data/views.json`. Workflow views should reuse
existing nodes and ordered flows; do not duplicate flow facts or invent
workflow-specific routing rules.

Keep flow diagrams free of orphaned elements. Every rendered node, edge, marker,
and label must be traceable to the selected flow, a selected supporting
relationship, or an explicit context relationship shown in the projection.
Remove disconnected context, connect it with a labeled relationship, or split it
into a separate view; do not leave loose boxes, endpoints, markers, or labels
for the reader to interpret. Prefer semantic iconography over UML/code diagrams
or broad flowchart shape palettes for flow enrichment. Mark decision, start,
stop, async, persistence, artifact, return, and process semantics with
`step.kind` when the flow needs them. For decision branches, set `step.outcome`
to the concrete branch/result label that should be readable on the path. A
decision branch should have at least two outgoing outcome steps from the
decision node, and those branch lines should share the decision step number. Do
not add UML/code diagrams for now.
For sequence diagrams, create explicit return paths
for request/response, command/result, event/acknowledgement, and failure-return
interactions when the flow requires them. Mark return steps with `kind:
"return"` and `returnOf` when they answer a specific outbound step. Use
`sequenceFrames` for loops, retries, optional branches, and transaction or
consistency blocks so outbound and return messages are visibly grouped instead
of implied.

For source extraction work, produce a reviewable draft of proposed JSON changes
with source paths and confidence notes before editing data files. Never replace
validation with extracted claims.

For C4 views, keep Context, Container, and Component diagrams at their proper
abstraction level. Prefer splitting dense views over forcing tangled routing,
keep relationship labels visible, and treat duplicate node membership in one
C4 view as a documentation defect to repair in `docs/architext/data/views.json`.
Use explicit `scopeNodeId` metadata to make C4 drilldown navigable: a Context
node that represents the system should have a scoped Container view, a
decomposable Container node should have a scoped Component view, and a
decomposable Component node should have a scoped Code view when code-level
documentation exists. If a node is external or intentionally outside the
project boundary, leave it without a child view so the viewer can explain that
drilldown is unavailable.

Run the Architext validator after edits:

```sh
architext validate [path]
```

Use the local viewer for review:

```sh
architext serve [path]
```

The optional path defaults to the current directory. Target repositories should
not vendor or edit Architext viewer, schema, tool, package, or Vite files.
Those are owned by the globally installed `architext` package. Edit project
architecture, roadmap, and release data under `docs/architext/data/**/*.json`;
use `architext sync [path]` to install or migrate lifecycle metadata and
instructions.

Use `architext doctor [path]` to inspect installation health, including C4
document quality issues, and `architext doctor [path] --yes` to apply
deterministic repairs. `architext sync [path]` runs the same doctor diagnostics
before converging lifecycle state. Use `architext prompt [path]` to print the
current agent build-out or maintenance instructions.
Do not claim the architecture documentation is current if validation fails or
was skipped.
